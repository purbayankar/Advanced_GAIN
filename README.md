# Advanced_GAIN

An attempt to boost the performance of PyTorch implementation of(https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02920).

The code is taken from (https://github.com/dhanajitb/GAIN-Pytorch) and the code of generator and discriminator is modified.

The idea is to use Network Deconvolution(https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11926) model in generator and discriminator to improve the performance.

- Network deconvolution code: (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11926)
